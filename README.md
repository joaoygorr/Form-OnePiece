# Form Piece
This is a crud built with Tkinter.

# Running this project
To get this project up and running, you should start with Python installed on your computer. It is advisable to create a virtual environment to store your projects' dependencies separately. You can install the environment
```
python -m venv env
```

That will create a new folder `env` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on PowerShell or CMD:
```
.\env\scripts\activate.ps1 
```
```
.\env\scripts\activate.bat
```

I'm using MySQL!! Then install the project dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
pip install pyodbc-4.0.32-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```
Now you can run the project with this command
```
python main.py
```
